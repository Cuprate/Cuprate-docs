# Cuprate Documentation  

## About 

[Cuprate](github.com/Cuprate/cuprate) is an independent Monero node written from 
the ground up in Rust, the only other Monero node is monerod written in C/C++. Cuprate will help 
to secure the Monero network by acting as a "saftey net" if a critical implementation
vulnerability was to be found in monerod.

This book, curently under construction, will contain developer documentation for Cuprate and 
also general Monero documenation.
