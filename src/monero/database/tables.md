## LMDB Tables

> Be aware that the current database schema might change when Seraphis will be implemented. See: [https://github.com/seraphis-migration/wallet3/issues/11](https://github.com/seraphis-migration/wallet3/issues/11)

Monerod store every type of dynamic size under simple key-value tables. But any constant sized items (such as block's metadata for example) are stored as duplicated values in tables using dummy keys. Such tables are declared with DUPSORT & DUPFIXED flags. DUPSORT is a flag for the database to support duplicated data, DUPFIXED is used when the key is of a fixed size, to gain place
(8 bytes per key).

When talking about Subkey in this chapter, you must understand that the table use a dummy key and that the Subkey used to retrieve data is the first bytes, or prefix, of this data monerod is trying to get.
```
Normal table:
Key -> Value
Duplicate Table:
Dummykey -> {Subkey, Value}
The subkey is the first bytes of the data it tried to store.
```

Here's an explanation of all used flags from the [lmdb crate documentation](https://docs.rs/lmdb/latest/lmdb/struct.DatabaseFlags.html):

**MDB_INTEGERKEY** : Keys are binary integers in native byte order. Setting this option requires all keys to be the same size, typically 32 or 64 bits.

**MDB_DUPFIXED**: This flag may only be used in combination with DUP_SORT. This option tells the library that the data items for this database are all the same size, which allows further optimizations in storage and retrieval. When all data items are the same size, the GET_MULTIPLE and NEXT_MULTIPLE cursor operations may be used to retrieve multiple items at once.

**MDB_DUPSORT**: Duplicate keys may be used in the database. (Or, from another perspective, keys may have multiple data items, stored in sorted order.) By default keys must be unique and may have only a single data item.</br>

## List of tables

### blocks
***
**Flags**: MDB_INTEGERKEY</br>
**Key**: Block's height as `uint64_t` (8 bytes)</br>
**Value**: Block bytes as `cryptonote::Blobdata` (Dynamic size).</br>

This table store the entire blocks. They can be accessed through their height

**Value**: Block's height as a 64bit unsigned integer, `uint64_t` (8 bytes).</br>

This table define a relation for finding a block height based on its Keccak-256 Hash. The first version was a simple table
but the new one store through Duplicated data :
```cpp
	/* old table was k(hash), v(height).
     * new table is DUPFIXED, k(zeroval), v{hash, height}.
     */
```

### txs_prunable_tip
***
**Flags**: MDB_INTEGERKEY | MDB_DUPSORT | MDB_DUPFIXED</br>
**Subkey**: Transaction's ID as `uint64_t` (8 bytes)</br>

**Subkey**: Transaction's Hash as `char [32]`(8 bytes)</br>
**Value**: Transaction's ID unlock time, and block's height as `tx_data_t` (24 bytes).</br>

This table define the relation between transaction's hash (that can be found in blocks) and its transaction ID, transaction's unlock time and origin block's height.

### txs_outputs
***
**Flags**: MDB_INTEGERKEY</br>
**Key**: Transaction's ID as `uint64_t` (8 bytes)</br>
**Value**: Transaction's outputs indices (amount and amount idx) as a `vector` of `(uint64_t,uint64t)` (Dynamic Size)</br>

This table is used to quickly retrieve outputs of a specific transaction.

### output_txs
***
**Flags**: MDB_INTEGERKEY | MDB_DUPSORT | MDB_DUPFIXED</br>
**Subkey**: Output's global index (database-only type) as `uint64_t` (8 bytes)</br>
**Value**: Transaction's hash and output's local index as `(char [32], uint64_t)` (40 bytes).</br>

This table is used to retrieve an ouput's transaction and its corresponding local index in this transaction.

**Flags**: MDB_INTEGERKEY | MDB_DUPSORT | MDB_DUPFIXED</br>
**Key**: Output's amount as `uint64_t` (8 bytes)</br>
**Subkey**: Output's amount index as `uint64_t` (8 bytes)</br>
**Value**: Output's metadata as `output_data_t` (PreRCT: 42 bytes, PostRCT: 80 bytes).</br>

This table store the actual output data. Before RingCT, the outputs was sorted by their amount and then their local index for this specific amount. (this is why there is a Key **and** a Subkey). All post-RingCT output have an amount of 0 and are therefore stored under the zero key.

### spent_keys
***
**Flags**: MDB_INTEGERKEY | MDB_DUPSORT | MDB_DUPFIXED</br>
**Subkey**: Output's key image</br>

***
**Flags**: None</br>
**Key**: HardFork version as `uint8_t` (1 byte)</br>
**Value**: Starting height of the hardfork as `uint64_t` (8 bytes)</br>

This table was used to store hardfork starting height. But it was deprecated, since these were hardcoded into the node. In fact, if a node get a block with an unknown hardfork version, it automatically discard it.

### properties
***

This table is used to store the pruning seed and database version:</br>
**Key**: *version* -> **Value**: version of the database as `uint32_t`</br>
**Key**: *pruning_seed* -> **Value**: pruning seed as `uint32_t`</br>
Version is defined as follow in `db_lmdb.cpp`:

```cpp
#define VERSION 5
#define MDB_val_str(var, val) MDB_val var = {strlen(val) + 1, (void *)val}

/* ... */

  MDB_val_str(k, "version"); // MDB_val k = {strlen("version") + 1, (void *)"version"}
  MDB_val v;
  auto get_result = mdb_get(txn, m_properties, &k, &v);
```
And the pruning seed key is :
```cpp
MDB_val_str(k, "pruning_seed"); // MDB_val k = {strlen("pruning_seed") + 1, (void *)"pruning_seed"}
```
</br>
</br>
</br>

All flags has been extracted from the `BlockchainLMDB::open()` function in `db_lmdb.cpp`:
```cpp
void BlockchainLMDB::open(const std::string& filename, const int db_flags)
{
  
  ...
